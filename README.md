Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Sciences Department at UWâ€“Madison. 

My research primarily focuses on database theory, with a strong interest in applying theoretical insights to practical system design. Beyond databases, I am also interested in traditional systems topics such as operating systems and distributed systems.

Collaborations, discussions, and chats are welcome!
